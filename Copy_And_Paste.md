Perhaps it is not obvious but copy-and-paste works via the "standard" keys
  * control-c (copy)
  * control-v (paste)

In general, anywhere you have a text-panel or a text-field, you can copy and paste. The most commonly used location will be:
  * Quote panel: where you enter the symbols. You can copy the existing symbols or paste in from other source.
  * Google login in panel: paste in user name, password, portfolio name ...
