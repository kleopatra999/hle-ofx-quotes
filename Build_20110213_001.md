# Emergency Fixes #
An emergency fix. Yahoo quote server is returning quote entry with no security name. When that happens, the generated OFX file is malformed and is being rejected by MM (saying the file was corrupt). Fix is to use the symbol string when name is missing.

Bad OFX will have the following entries
  * OFX Version 1 (just the tag and empty line
```
<SECNAME>
```
  * OFX Version 2
```
<SECNAME />
```

If the list is small, you can hand fix by fill in the value for SECNAME. For example, using the ticker symbol will work.
```
<SECNAME>AAPL</SECNAME>
```

# Changes #

  * **Warn of suspicious price**: add option to warn if price from quote source looks suspicious. I've seen Yahoo returning bad price in the past in particular during late night, early hours on week-end. Default value is 10,000. To disable, set it to -1.
```
Edit -> Warn Suspicious Price
```
  * **Date Offset**: -1 means force the trade date from what the quote source says minus 1 day. Default is 0.
```
Edit -> Date Offset
```
  * **New column for ft.com**: Support a new column `Quote Date & Time` for ft.com quote source. You can use this column to specify the trade date. Sample format **Feb 07 2011 00:00 GMT**
```
