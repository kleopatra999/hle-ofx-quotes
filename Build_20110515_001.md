# Introduction #

Build\_20110515\_001 Release Notes

# Changes #
  * New functionality: auto-click Money "Import" dialog. When you download an OFX quotes/statement, Money will post a dialog box. If you have a lot of download, having to click multiple dialogs can be an annoyance. This feature will look for the dialog box and auto-click it to pop it down. To disable this feature, deselect the checkbox in menu:
```
Tools -> Import dialog auto-click
```
  * I disable the following previously-available menu by mistake. I will fix this in the next build.
```
File -> New -> Financial Institution
```
