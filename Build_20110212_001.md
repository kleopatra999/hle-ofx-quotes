# Changes #

An emergency fix. Yahoo quote server is returning quote entry with no security name. When that happens, the generated OFX file is malformed and is being rejected by MM (saying the file was corrupt). Fix is to use the symbol string when name is missing.

Bad OFX will have the following entries
  * OFX Version 1 (just the tag and empty line
```
<SECNAME>
```
  * OFX Version 2
```
<SECNAME />
```

If the list is small, you can hand fix by fill in the value for SECNAME. For example, using the ticker symbol will work.
```
<SECNAME>AAPL</SECNAME>
```
