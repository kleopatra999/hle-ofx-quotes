Many have asked about the source codes. I am working on it ;-).

There is no hidden agenda here (or sinister plot to try to steal you financial information). The truth of the matter is that the codes for this tool is part of a bigger project with some hard to remove dependency. I am working on getting that cleanup. Like any form of cleanup, re-factoring, things tend to involve large changes and my priority right now is that I rather keep things stable.

Some background, when M$ announced that they have given up on Microsoft Money, I started to work on an idea for a MM replacement. The quote tool hleOfxQuotes is a part of that project. I have no problem releasing the quote tool source code but still feel that there are some potential values for the original half-finished MM replacement attempt.

**Bottom line**: I am working on removing the dependency to free the quote tool source code but it is not really my priority right now.
