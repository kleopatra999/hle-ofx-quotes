*hleOfxQuotes* writes to a log file name *hleOfxQuotes-log.txt* located in the same directory as the jar file.

You can also get the name of the log file via the output of
{{{
Help -> About
}}}

The tool also writes the log entries to standard output, so if manually start *hleOfxQuotes* from a command window, you will also see the running output of the log
{{{
Window 
  Run -> cmd

java -jar hleOfxQuotes-XXXj.jar

should see log entries here ...
}}}

To start a cmd window, see also: http://pcsupport.about.com/od/commandlinereference/f/open-command-prompt.htm

The library that *hleOfxQuotes* uses to log is log4j. See: http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/
