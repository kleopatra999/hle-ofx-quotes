= Changes =

  * *Warn of suspicious price*: add option to warn if price from quote source looks suspicious. I've seen Yahoo returning bad price in the past in particular during late night, early hours on week-end. Default value is 10,000. To disable, set it to -1.
{{{
Edit -> Warn Suspicious Price
}}}
  * *Date Offset*: -1 means force the trade date from what the quote source says minus 1 day. Default is 0.
{{{
Edit -> Date Offset
}}}
  * *New column for ft.com*: Support a new column {{{Quote Date & Time}}} for ft.com quote source. You can use this column to specify the trade date. Sample format *Feb 07 2011 00:00 GMT*
