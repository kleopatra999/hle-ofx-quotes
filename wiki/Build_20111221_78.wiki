== Update FX (foreign exchange rate) ==
  * Use sunriise to update FX rates.
  * *IMPORTANT*: the most important thing to remember is that we are modifying the `*`.mny file *directly*. As such, 
    ** Money should NOT be running. Or more specifically, the `*`.mny file to be updated is NOT currently opened by Money.
    ** and you should try first on a copy of `*`.mny.
  * Please see this issue for background info: http://code.google.com/p/hle-ofx-quotes/issues/detail?id=27
  * Overview:
    * Download FX quotes using Yahoo quote source and the pseudo-symbol (for example: EURUSD=X)
    * Use sunriise to open `*`.mny file in writable mode and update the exchange rate.
  * There is a new tab named "Exchange Rates"
