#summary How to download and convert Scholarshare price to OFX

= Introduction =

The ScholarShare College Savings Plan recently transitioned to a new manager, from Fidelity Investments to TIAA-CREF Tuition Financing (under the ScholareShare California 529 College Savings Plan). Unfortunately, TIAA-CREF does not provide downloadable daily price updates. What available is this web page: http://www.scholarshare.com/performance/fundperformance.shtml

= Details =

Starting with build: Build_20111221_78 (http://code.google.com/p/hle-ofx-quotes/downloads/detail?name=hleOfxQuotes-Build_20111221_78-app.jar), *hleofxquotes* support a pseudo-quote-source named *Scholarshare* to make it possible to download the Scholarshare daily price update.

  * *hleofxquotes* will read the content of http://www.scholarshare.com/performance/fundperformance.shtml
  * Parse for price info and convert them into a `*`.ofx file
 

== Usage ==
 
You use the new *Scholarshare* quote source the same as other quote sources:
  # Enter symbols
  # Choose to update price
  # Import into MsMoney

== Quote source symbol ==

There are no public symbols for the Scholarshare investments, so we will need to come up with a scheme to auto-create the symbols. I will refer to these as the *quote source symbol*. Current scheme
  * Part 1: Take the first letter of portfolio name. For example, for *Active Age-Based Investment Portfolio Option*, we reduce that to AABIPO
  * Part 2: Again first letter of the investment name. For example, for *Age Band 9-10*, we reduce that to AB910
So for above example, the *quote source symbol* is *AABIPOAB910*. 

== MsMoney symbol ===

Internally to MsMoney, you should use shorter 4-char symbol, pick something that does not collide with your existing investment symbols. For example, I use SC1, SC2 ... 

Then I use the mapper.csv file to map the *quote source symbol* to the *MsMoney source symbol*. (See: http://code.google.com/p/hle-ofx-quotes/wiki/mapperDotCsv)
