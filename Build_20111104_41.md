  * A new tab is added to let you download historical quotes from Yahoo
  * You can only work with one symbol at the time
  * Default date range is the last 30 days
  * We have to generate one OFX file per day. So if you ask for 30-day quotes, 30 OFX files will get generated and imported. Two things to be aware of:
    1. Make sure you have the 'Import dialog auto-click' enable. You don't want to have to manually click 30 times on the popup dialog
```
Tools -> Import dialog auto-click (check to enable)
```
    1. MsMoney takes its time to import so try a reasonable date range first (like a month). I've tested a year worth of quotes.
  * When you click on the 'Update prices' button, you will be prompted for a date range, you can enter the date directly or click on the icon on the right of the text to popup a calendar.


## Convert CSV file to OFX ##

  * See: http://code.google.com/p/hle-ofx-quotes/wiki/Csv2OfxCmd
  * That wiki mention an older download. Just replace the `*`.jar filename with the current released file.
  * Usage
```
java -cp hleOfxQuotes-Build_20111104_41-app app.Csv2OfxCmd sample1.csv sample1.ofx csv2ofx.props
```
  * Best to create a batch file to make the above command easier to run
